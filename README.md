To analyze theatre distribution across countries using MySQL, you can create three tables: countries, cities, and theatres. I'll walk you through the table structure, some sample data, and queries that can help you analyze the distribution.

Table Structure
countries Table: Contains information about different countries.
cities Table: Contains information about cities, including the country they belong to.
